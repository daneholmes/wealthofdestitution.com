Far away and far in the future Leiv sat outside watching the world pass by.

On this night, the fourth day after midsummer, when lingering dark begins intertwining with endless days, and the heather night restlessly watches over all things. Both good and bad become bathed in light and the reborn darkness. The sempiternal ice shone deeply a subdued purple. The stone of the towering cliffs lining the rivers flowing inland, and the moss which crowned these walls shivered.

And there Leiv, Erik’s third son, stood alone at the mouth of a great bay.

He stood under the new dark and the constant light. He stood with the snow and moss beside the rivers and cliffs. And he shivered with the land.

After moments of motionlessness, suddenly, Leiv turned his back on the bay and the ocean which fed it. On the sheltered surface of the bay wooden boats floated, waiting and empty.

Just as abruptly as Leiv’s movement away, a swift mist and fog drifted down the rivers from the heart of the island and began covering the ocean’s bay. Before Leiv was two stone throws from the shore, the ocean— whose infinite breadth stretched past the horizon—disappeared, shrouded by a white sheet.

As he walked and the mist closed in around the world. Emptying Leiv’s vision. And he said to himself, “to be is to live, and to live is to do. I do and I will die doing.”

A short way off the bay laid a small settlement called Budardalur. Its population, hardly two hundred strong, mostly concerned themselves with fishing and hunting. And a few among the population deemed themselves traders. Though there infrequently, they brought goods too and from Budardalur. And during their long rests, in between voyages called the land home.

The town was made up of earthen houses of various sizes. Scarcely more than hills hollowed out with a door and a window or two. Upon these houses, domed walls and ceilings grass grew. And on the west side of every home odd blue and purple flowers danced and grew. These dwellings were scattered about in a disorganized fashion. Yet, were compact enough that a leisurely walk through the town, down the worn muddy paths, to the river passed the outskirts would take all but five minutes.

It was this path Leiv took, talking to himself, turning away from the river feeding the ocean and bay.

The path he walked led him path the homes of men and women he had come to live with. Besides the small fenced-in areas where horses were kept for the night. A man, named Bjarni, a trader, recently returned home watched Leiv pass as he put away his nets, ropes, and other small instruments of commerce.

At the center of Budardalur was a building, bigger than the rest but no grander. Save that it was the most densely covered in the beautiful flowers. It was towards this building Leiv walked slowly and distractedly.

Bjarni, still watching Leiv pass guessed that this building is where he was headed to and hastened his unpacking telling himself, “though I was gone for only six months if that walk is any indication Leiv is a changed man. For in the winter when I left him, his strides were long and his gate confidently pointed ahead. Now he walks slowly eyes cast up and away, thinking. I will talk to him, I will.” And he hasted to unpack the bag tied to a saddle.

Leiv walked, and despite his weary steps reached the central hall before his murmured conversation came to an end. Inside and the central fire glowed, heating and hall, without the burden of flames and smoke. At tables scattered a random, a few dozen men sat in conversation. The odd table was aroused in joyous merriment. But most sat in quiet conversation. Leiv took a table near the door and sat alone, still muttering to himself.

Later, the night passed by, caught between the unending light of the summer and the encroaching darkness brought on by fall. As the sky struggled, resolving to lilac hues around midnight, Leiv lied motionless in bed, caught between sleep and life. In a stupor, Leiv lay dreaming or thinking—he did not know which—of what he wished would be and was sad. For once a desire felt or wish made, hope of it happening should be slight.
